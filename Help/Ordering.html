<h3>How do I order?</h3>
<p><span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span> adopts a <a href="http://www.winzip.com/" target="_blank">WinZip</a>-style 
  shareware approach. You are given 21 days to evaluate <span class="wwhiz">Workspace 
  Whiz!</span>, and then you must order it.</p>
<p>Ordering is a simple process. The ordering system is provided by the very popular 
  and reliable <a href="http://www.regnow.com/" target="_blank">Register Now!</a> 
  service.</p>
<p>Workspace Whiz costs $10.00 U.S. Please read the <a href="License.html">license 
  agreement</a> first.</p>

<h3>Why shareware?</h3>
<p>Several years ago, I began creating an add-in by the name of Project File Open. 
  I built it entirely for myself as a way to speed-up some common operations I 
  performed daily under Developer Studio. One day, a coworker saw it and demanded 
  he be able to use it, too. Soon, everyone in the office was using my add-in, 
  and the feature requests began flying in. I renamed the add-in to the Workspace 
  Utilities.</p>
<p>Quite a while later, that same coworker wondered what I thought about posting 
  the Workspace Utilities to CodeGuru. I did, and more user feedback than I could 
  ever imagine began pouring in. Thousands of downloads later, I began creating 
  <span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span> This time, it wasn't about me, but 
  it was about all my users.</p>
<p><span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span> has been in active (i.e. spare time) 
  development now for well over a year. I have tried to add every feature my users 
  have ever requested. I've succeeded in implementing most features.</p>
<p>In turning <span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span> into a high quality product, 
  it has cost me both time and money. To justify some of the expense, I ask that 
  users who find <span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span> useful contribute 
  to <span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span>'s future development by ordering 
  it.</p>
