<h3 align="left">Tags</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="PreferencesTags.png" width="415" height="390"></p>
<p align="left">The Tags preferences are used to modify various tag compilation 
  features.</p>
<p align="left">The <span class="field">Modify tag file extensions:</span> portion 
  of the dialog allows assignment of all file extensions considered for tag compilation. 
  Although the default extensions only provide support for C++ oriented files, 
  Exuberant Ctags can also build tags from Java files, too.</p>
<p align="left">The <span class="field">Modify tag file extensions:</span> edit 
  field is used to enter new extensions. The <span class="field">Add</span> button 
  will add the extension being edited to the end of the extension list. The <span class="field">Remove</span> 
  button will remove the currently selected extension. The <span class="field">Reset</span> 
  button will restore the Workspace Whiz defaults.</p>
<p>When finding the tag under the cursor, checking <span class="field">Always 
  use dialog for Find Tag at Cursor</span> will always show the <a href="FindTagDialog.html">Find 
  Tag dialog</a> with the matched symbols, whether there were any tag ambiguities 
  or not. Tag ambiguities happen when there are more than one tag. If this field 
  is unchecked and only one tag is found, it will be moved to instantly.</p>
<p align="left">When <span class="field">Automatic refresh of tags </span> is 
  checked, source files are automatically scanned for changes by date/time stamp. 
  For large number of files, this process can take a while. If unchecked, tags 
  are never refreshed unless the <span class="field">Refresh Tags</span> button 
  in the <a href="FindTagDialog.html">Find Tag dialog</a> is pressed.</p>
<p align="left">When <i>Scan files on task switch</i> is checked, all files are 
  checked when switching back to Visual Studio from another application.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">When <span class="field">Automatic Save All issued per each tag 
  command</span> is checked, a File->Save All command is issued before each tag 
  command. If it is unchecked, no files are saved, but the Find Tag dialog's Refresh 
  Tags button will save the files and check for changes.</p>
<p align="left">Saving tags can be a slower process, so it is only done according 
  the amount in the <span class="field">Save tags after # file saves</span> field.</p>
<p align="left"></p>
<p align="left">Due to the new, faster tag system, tag files will continue growing 
  larger and larger until packed. <i>Workspace Whiz</i> can automatically pack 
  the tag files, but the packing process is not a quick process. The number of 
  tags that must change before packing the tag file may be entered in the <span class="field">Pack 
  tag file after # changes</span> field.</p>
<p align="left">Exuberant Ctags doesn't pay full attention to the syntax of the 
  code it is parsing. In particular, #define macros aren't parsed. On occasion, 
  macros cause problems when Exuberant Ctags parses the code. The <span class="field">Modify 
  tokens to ignore during tag parse:</span> field allows input of tokens that 
  will be ignored.</p>
<p align="left">The simplest format for an ignored token is just the token itself. 
  By default, Workspace Whiz ignores the token <span class="code">DECLARE_DYNAMIC</span>. 
  A specialized form for ignoring tokens is actually a redefinition. For example, 
  if the token <span class="code">CLASS</span> was #define'd to be <span class="code">class</span> 
  in a section of code, the Workspace Whiz form would be <span class="code">CLASS=class</span>. 
  The final form is following the identifier with a <span class="code">+</span> 
  symbol. This causes source code that looks like a function to be ignored.</p>

  in the <a href="http://darren.hiebert.com/ctags" class="wwhiz">Exuberant Ctags</a> 
  manual. </p>
