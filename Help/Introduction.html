<h2 align="left">Introduction</h2>
<p align="left"><font size="-1"><i>Note: Workspace Whiz is the successor of the 
  Workspace Utilities.</i></font></p>
<p align="left"><span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span> is a powerful Visual 
  Studio add-in designed to improve developers' productivity by allowing quicker 
  source navigation and coding. <span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span> adds 
  a number of commands that may be used on a Visual Studio toolbar or assignable 
  to a key on the keyboard. Each command is individually tweaked for the most 
  efficient keyboard and mouse use.</p>
<p></p>
<p align="left"><span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span> works with Visual C++ 
  5.0, Visual C++ 6.0, <i>and</i> eMbedded Visual C++ 3.0.</p>
<p>A short overview of the major <span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span> features 
  follows:</p>
<h4><b><a href="FileOpen.html">Workspace File Open:</a></b></h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p><span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span>'s <span class="command">Workspace 
    File Open</span> command incrementally matches any file in the workspace. 
    In addition, external projects and workspaces can be <a href="ExtraFiles.html">added 
    to the search list</a>. When searching, it is unnecessary to type symbols, 
    such as underscores. The <span class="command">Workspace File Open</span> 
    command is an efficient method of finding and opening any desired file, without 
    regard to location.</p>
  </blockquote>
<h4><a href="GlobalFileOpen.html">Global File Open:</a></h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Built using the same, efficient environment as the <span class="command">Workspace 
    File Open</span> command, the <span class="command">Global File Open</span> 
    command incrementally matches any file in the global Include and Source directories. 
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<h4></h4>
<h4><a href="HeaderFlip.html">Workspace Header Flip:</a></h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p><span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span>'s <span class="command">Workspace 
    Header Flip</span> opens the current file's &quot;alternate&quot; file (i.e. 
    from .cpp to .h) by searching workspace-wide for the correct, matching file. 
    The header file doesn't even have to be in the same directory as its related 
    source file!</p>
  </blockquote>
<h4><a href="FindTag.html">Find Tag:</a></h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The <span class="command">Find Tag</span> dialog is a robust graphical extension 
    to Darren Hiebert's excellent <a href="http://darren.hiebert.com/ctags" class="wwhiz" target="_blank">Exuberant 
    Ctags</a> software. It incrementally matches any identifier in the workspace 
    or any <a href="ExtraFiles.html">external projects or workspaces</a> specified.</p>
  <p>Several variations of the <span class="command">Find Tag</span> command are 
    available. One variation shows all functions in a source file. Another finds 
    the tag under the cursor. Yet another toggles between the declaration and 
    definition of a tag. There are also commands for cycling through similar tags.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4><a href="FileHistory.html">File History:</a></h4>
<h4></h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p>For every <span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span> command executed, the 
    current caret location and file is added to a history. Use of the history 
    is convenient, for instance, when opening a file to a particular tag and restoring 
    the environment to the original source file in a single keystroke.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4></h4>
<h4><a href="TagComplete.html">Autocomplete Tags:</a></h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p>The <span class="command">Tag Complete</span> command is a natural extension 
    of <span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span>'s tag support. Partially typed 
    identifiers are automatically completed by the <span class="command">Tag Complete</span> 
    command. Like most <span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span> functions, the 
    <span class="command">Tag Complete</span> command can take advantage of any 
    external projects or workspaces specified.</p>
  </blockquote>
<h4><a href="CodeTemplates.html">Code Templates:</a></h4>
<blockquote> 
  <p><span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span> contains powerful code template 
    functionality for creating reusable snippets of code, categorizing them, and 
    providing easy graphical access to the templates. User input may be obtained 
    through HTML dialog pages which exist with the individual templates. The HTML 
    dialog pages may take advantage of JavaScript to provide an intuitive end-user 
    experience.</p>
  <p>There are also powerful template constructs which may be used as a simpler 
    alternative to the Developer Studio AppWizard.</p>
