<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>If there are external files (such as workspaces or projects) the application 
  requires but whose files don't exist in the workspace, <span class="wwhiz">Workspace 
  Whiz!</span> allows those files to be transparently added via the <i>Extra Files</i> 
  dialog. The Extra Files specified are used in the file finding and tag selection 
  facilities.</p>
<p>Extra Files filenames can take advantage of environment variables. Environment 
  variables specified as paths provide an excellent method to base project, workspace, 
  or file paths from. The same environment variable on one developer's system 
  can point to an entirely different location on another developer's system! </p>
<p>Filenames use the same syntax Visual Studio requires: </p>
<p><code>$(MYLIB)\Prj\MyLib.dsp</code> </p>
<p>The Extra Files settings are stored in a file called <span class="code">ExtraFiles.WW</span>. 
  This file is stored in the same directory as the workspace.</p>
<p> Extra Files are also available when no workspace is open. Add them the same 
  as when a workspace is open.</p>
