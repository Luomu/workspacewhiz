<h3 align="left">Template title disappearance</h3>
<p>Intermittently, when viewing the Template File List, the template group title 
  will be blank, but the path will still be filled in correctly. Sometimes the 
  templates within that group work, sometimes they don't.</p>
<p>This is a bug, but it is rarely reproducible.</p>
<p><i>Resolution:</i> Remove the template group in question and readd it.</p>
<p></p>

<h3>Keyboard paste from clipboard doesn't work</h3>
<p>This will remain documented here, although it has been determined this is <i><b>not</b></i> 
  a <i>Workspace Whiz</i> problem. Instead, there seems to be a pattern of it 
  only occuring when <i>any</i> macro is used.</p>
<p>Occasionally, there are intermittent problems pasting text into Developer Studio. 
  This will only result when copying an entire line (not a portion of a line). 
  The entire line can be copied to the clipboard and pasted into another app (like 
  Notepad), but the paste function in Developer Studio will not work. Then, seemingly 
  out of the blue, it works fine.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Knowledge Base has a variation of this problem. Article Q231652 
  describes the Paste command failing under NT4 when Service Pack 4 is applied.</p>
<p>Additional occurrences have been reported by <span class="wwhiz">Workspace 
  Whiz</span> users under Windows NT4 SP5 and SP6 and Windows 2000 Build 2195. 
  All occurrences have happened with Visual C++ 6.0 SP3. No Visual C++ 5.0 reports 
  have been made, although the Knowledge Base article confirms it happening for 
  VC5.</p>
