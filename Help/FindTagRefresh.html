<h3>Refreshing or Rebuilding Tags</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In its default behavior, <span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span> will automatically 
  sense when a file has changed and update the tag list accordingly. Unfortunately, 
  if the workspace contains hundreds of files, this detection process can be somewhat 
  slow.</p>
<p>The <span class="field"><a href="PreferencesTags.html">Preferences Tags</a></span> 
  dialog offers a way to turn off the automatic refresh of tags. When a <span class="wwhiz">Workspace 
  Whiz!</span> tag command is issued, the tag command will potentially execute 
  a lot faster.</p>
<p>The Find Tag dialog offers a <span class="field">Refresh Tags</span> button. 
  The <span class="field">Refresh Tags </span> button does the same thing as the 
  automatic refresh, but the operation is performed at user discretion. Tags generally 
  don't need to be refreshed every time a file is saved, unless the changes made 
  to the file alter attributes such as function signatures or global variables 
  (or other items pertaining to the tag type in question). Pressing this button 
  causes a Save All to be performed.</p>
<p>Although it should be rarely used, a <span class="field">Rebuild Tags</span> 
  button is also provided. Using it will completely rebuild the entire tags database.</p>
