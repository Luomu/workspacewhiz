<h2 align="left">Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>I hope I didn't forget anybody!</p>
<ul>
  <li>The love of my life, my wife, and my dear friend, <b>Kacey</b>, who is my 
    inspiration and everything I live for.</li>
  <li>My two sons, <b>Bryston</b> and <b>Collin</b>. I love 'em lots... but I 
    still want a little girl... :)<br>
    <br>
    <em>News update:</em> On July 26, 2002, not only did I get my little girl, 
    <strong>Shaela</strong>, but I also got another boy, <strong>Colby</strong>!</li>
  <li><b>Oz Solomonovich</b> - I have <i>great</i> respect for his technical prowess. 
    If you haven't grabbed WndTabs, do so now! Go to <a href="http://www.wndtabs.com/" target="_blank">http://www.wndtabs.com/</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Jerzy Kaczorowski</b> - I've never seen anybody find bugs like Jerzy. 
    He has single-handedly reported the <b>most</b> crash bugs out of everybody! 
    In addition, his feature requests are well thought out. Jerzy has contributed 
    a great deal to the design of <span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span>. Jerzy 
    has an add-in for accessing CVS under Visual Studio. Get it at <a href="http://www.cvsin.org/" target="_blank">http://www.cvsin.org/</a>.</li>
  <li>All those people and companies who have ordered <span class="wwhiz">Workspace 
    Whiz.</span> Thanks!</li>
  <li><b>Nick Hodapp </b> - Nick has hacked into the Visual Studio internals like 
    I've never seen before. He is the reason that WWhizInterface is able to provide 
    the current workspace name. Nick now works as the Visual C++ Program Manager.</li>
  <li><b>Hans Buehler</b>'s cdxCDynamicDialog is incredible! It makes everything 
    in <span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span> resizable, and it was a breeze 
    to set up! Find it on <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/" target="_blank">http://www.codeproject.com/</a>.</li>
  <li><b>Greg Thoenen</b>, <b><a href="http://www.bucketobits.com/chris" target="_blank">Chris 
    Nash</a></b>, <b>Eric Grundstrom</b>, <b>Brian Loss</b>, <b>John Pursey</b>, 
    and the rest of the ex-Engineering Animation, Inc. Salt Lake City and Ames 
    Interactive Division employees who let me use them as guinea pigs during development.</li>
  <li><b>Chris Maunder</b> for his LVN_GETDISPINFO string pool trick. Additionally, 
    he has created an incredible code development site, <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/" target="_blank"><b>Code 
    Project</b></a>.</li>
  <li><b>Sven Axelsson</b> provided the idea and initial implementation of the 
    template @@(Sel)@@ command.</li>
  <li><b>Darryl Yust</b> for numerous header flipper suggestions and mentioning 
    the tab order in the WUFileOpen dialog was incorrect.</li>
  <li><b>Herbert Goisser</b> for providing me with detailed error logs in an attempt 
    to fix the Visual Studio 97 support.</li>
  <li><b>Ville Herva</b> for the .cxx header flip suggestion and providing information 
    on why the tag support didn't work with spaces in the project names (and a 
    fix, too!).</li>
  <li><b>Lee Hillman</b> provided a fix to the tag bug, too.</li>
  <li><b>Michael Sullivan</b> for his file/project scoping fix in the Find Tag 
    dialog.</li>
  <li><b>Jim Rittenhouse</b> for providing countless words of encouragement and 
    offering the first graphical icons to <span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz.</span></li>
  <li><b>David Brady</b> provided some of the <span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span> 
    toolbar icons.</li>
  <li>Everyone who reported bugs and participated in the <span class="wwhiz">Workspace 
    Whiz</span> beta program. Your patience and diligence in discovering bugs 
    and offering feature ideas has made <span class="wwhiz">Workspace Whiz</span> 
    a much better application.</li>
  <li>The rest of the kind individuals who have passed a word of thanks my way. 
    It is appreciated.</li>
  <li>Anybody I missed... please contact me if I've used your code and haven't 
    credited you for it! :-(</li>
