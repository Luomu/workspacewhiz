<h2 align="left">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p><i><b>Why does my workspace open and close more slowly after using tags?</b></i></p>
<p> For workspaces with very large number of tags, opening and closing the workspace 
  can take longer. So the tags don't have to be rebuilt the next time the workspace 
  is opened, Workspace Whiz saves the tag list to disk on workspace close. It 
  reads those tags on workspace open.</p>
<p>If the workspace open and close time appears to be taking exceedingly long, 
  try turning Workspace Whiz off. If it still takes a long time to open the workspace, 
  then the workspace.opt file has become corrupt. Delete it. (This is mentioned 
  in the Microsoft Knowledge Base.)</p>
<p>The status bar should show the tag loading and saving.</p>
<p><b><i>Whenever I use a tag function, the title bar says &quot;Checking for 
  updates...&quot; It sits there for a long time. What gives?</i></b></p>
<p>Workspace Whiz is checking date/time stamps on all of the files tags are generated 
  from. This is how it can automatically keep the tag list in sync with changes 
  to your source files.</p>
<p>You can perform the refresh manually. First, go to the <span class="field">Preferences</span>-&gt;<span class="field">Tags</span> 
  dialog and uncheck the check box which reads &quot;<span class="field">Automatic 
  refresh of tags per each tag command</span>.&quot; Now, the refresh won't automatically 
  happen. Press the <span class="field">Refresh Tags</span> button to perform 
  the sync yourself.</p>
