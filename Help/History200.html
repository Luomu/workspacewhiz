<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Find File and Find Tag's context menus take keypresses again.</li>
  <li><b>Tags:</b> Fixed an obscure bug where inherits lists were super long. 
    Exuberant Ctags still parses them incorrectly, but Workspace Whiz tries to 
    make up for it.</li>
  <li><b>Templates:</b> !!Goto went to the correct place in the code, but wouldn't 
    execute a !! command if it existed at the goto location.</li>

    tree now goes to the file properly (without left clicking first).</li>
  <li><b>Templates:</b> If a colon is used inside a substitution command @@sub 
    &quot;:&quot;:U@@ inside quotes, it is parsed properly.</li>

    left and right justification commands.</li>

<h2>5/26/2000 - Beta 4e</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>Tags:</b> The tag and parent edit fields in the Find Tag dialog now accept 
    mixed case. When mixed case is used, a case sensitive match is automatically 
    performed. The case sensitive match may be toggled off by inserting a dash 
    <span class="code">-</span> in the tag.</li>
  <li><b>Tags:</b> Special characters may be inserted at any point in the tag 
    and parent edit fields of the Find Tag dialog. The <span class="code">+</span> 
    symbol turns case sensitive matching on. The <span class="code">\</span> symbol 
    forces an exact length match of the tag. The <span class="code">=</span> symbol 
    forces an exact length match <i>and</i> case sensitive match. The <span class="code">-</span> 
    symbol turns case sensitive matching off.</li>
  <li><b>Tags:</b> Fixed the Find Tag title bar and status bar refresh problem 
    after adding a new Extra Files project.</li>
  <li><b>Templates:</b> Inserting a <span class="code">%&quot;</span> will cause 
    a quote mark to appear in the outputted text. <span class="code">%&quot;</span> 
    should only be necessary when using quotation marks to surround large strings 
    with spaces. See <span class="code">UsefulSamples.WWTpl</span> for an example.</li>
  <li><font color="#CC0000"><b>Templates:</b></font><b><font color="#CC0000"> 
    I made a huge error when implementing expression tags. Regrettably, any instances 
    of <span class="code">@@!!Command@@</span> in your code must be changed to 
    <span class="code">@@(Command)@@</span>. The new syntax allows embedded tag 
    parameters, whereas the old syntax couldn't allow it. The example below runs 
    a command called <span class="code">Command</span> with two arguments: the 
    contents of <span class="code">variable</span> and the return code from <span class="code">AnotherCommand</span>.</font></b></li>
  <blockquote> 
    <p><font color="#CC0000"><b><span class="code">@@(Command @@variable@@ @@(AnotherCommand)@@)@@</span></b></font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <li><b>Templates:</b> When using the old <span class="code">@@!!Command@@</span> 
    syntax, Workspace Whiz will report an error.</li>
  <li><b>Templates:</b> When an error occurs in a template, the line number is 
    made available. Additionally, Workspace Whiz will open the <span class="code">.WWTpl</span>

    added.</li>
  <li><b>Templates:</b> Right clicking on a template in the template tree view 
    will open the appropriate .WWTpl file to that template for editing. (Bug: 
    You must first left click on the template and THEN right click.)</li>
  <li>Tries to autodetect the Workspace Whiz toolbar.</li>
  <li>Fixed the Preferences-&gt;Key Bindings pages to allow the Enter key to be 
    pressed.</li>
