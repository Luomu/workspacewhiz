.topic IDC_COM_ABOUT
Open Workspace Whiz's About dialog.

.topic IDC_COM_EXTRAFILES
Manipulate extra files (including workspaces and projects) used in the
workspace file list.  These extra files are usually not in the open
Visual Studio workspace.  Extra files are very useful for external
libraries the application uses.

.topic IDC_COM_PREFERENCES
Open the Preferences dialog.  From here, various parameters governing
Workspace Whiz's operation may be manipulated.

.topic IDC_COM_CURRENTFILE
Perform various Visual Studio and shell operations from the File Context
Menu on the current file.

.topic IDHELP
Open the context-sensitive help.

.topic IDC_FF_FILES
The list of files matching the search criteria.  Right-clicking or pressing
the Windows Context Menu key on a file opens a context menu allowing various
Visual Studio and shell operations to be performed on the file.

.topic IDC_FF_FILENAME
The filename being incrementally searched for. The search is not case
sensitive, and symbols, such as underscores, are ignored.

Enter a / or * at any point in the filename to act as a wildcard.

Enter a . at any point to begin an extension search.

Enter a : or , at the end of the filename followed by a line number to go to
that line.

Use the arrow keys, Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down for navigation within
the list of files.

.topic IDC_FF_REFRESH
Force a reload of the file list.

.topic IDC_FF_SCOPE_PROJECT
Change the scope of the file list to files within the current project.

.topic IDC_FF_SCOPE_WORKSPACE

(including extra projects).

.topic IDC_FF_PREFIX
A prefix, if any, to prepend to the filename being incrementally searched
for.

.topic IDC_EP_LIST
The list of additional projects and workspaces to be added for searching.
Those files starting with $(ENV) use an environment variable for
directory name resolution.  This way, Extra Files may be shared
among many users.

.topic IDC_EP_ADD
Add the specified project or workspace to the list.  If the beginning of the
filename is matched against an environment variable, an option to replace the
absolute path with the environment path will be presented.

.topic IDC_EP_REMOVE
Remove the selected project or workspace from the list.

.topic IDC_EP_FILENAME
The filename to be added to the list.  If the filename starts with $(ENV),
where ENV is an environment variable name, then the path is an absolute
environment path.  That is, the environment variable is used to resolve the
path.  This makes it possible to share Extra Files with many users.

Example: $(COOLLIB)\Project\CoolLib.dsw

.topic IDC_EP_BROWSE
Browse for an additional file, project, or workspace.

.topic IDC_FT_TAGS

the Windows Context Menu key on a tag opens a context menu.

.topic IDC_FT_PARENT
The parent of the tag being searched for, such as a class or enumeration.

.topic IDC_FT_NAME

default, not case sensitive and symbols such as underscores are ignored.

The search string is broken into two parts: the tag name and the parent
(i.e. the name of the class a member function belongs to).

Enter a / or * at any point in the tag (and/or parent) to begin a substring
search.  Multiple substrings may be found by specifying a / or * more than
once.

Enter a ; at any point to begin the parent search.

Enter a + at any point to toggle case sensitivity on.  Alternatively, entering
a capital letter turns case sensitivity on.

Enter a - at any point to toggle case sensitivity off.

Enter a \ (backslash) at any point to cause only tags of the same length to
be matched.

Enter a = at any point to cause an exact match to occur, case sensitive and
same length.

Enter a ' at any point to isolate tags of a certain type.

Use the arrow keys, Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down for navigation within
the list of tags.
